# SevenOfSevens Expansion Roadmap (200% Content Increase)

This document outlines the strategic plan to triple the content of *SevenOfSevens*, transforming it from a simple idle game into a complex automation and strategy idle experience.

## Phase 1: The Automation Update (Logic & Control)
**Goal:** Deepen the "wiring" mechanic, turning the board into a programmable circuit.

*   **New Modules:**
    *   **Splitter:** Takes 1 signal input, outputs to 2 different targets.
    *   **Merger:** Takes 2 signal inputs, combines them into 1 stronger signal (or just passes through).
    *   **Randomizer:** Takes 1 input, outputs to a random connected target.
    *   **Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, DELAY):** Basic logic to control signal flow based on conditions (e.g., "Only pass if value > 5").
    *   **Sensor Node:** Detects specific numbers rolled by neighbors and emits a signal.

*   **New Resource:**
    *   **Data:** Generated by processing signals through Logic Gates. Used to upgrade the *efficiency* of connections (faster signals, less energy cost).

## Phase 2: The Casino Update (Variety)
**Goal:** Add horizontal progression with new "Toys" that offer different risk/reward profiles.

*   **New Modules:**
    *   **Slot Machine (3-Reel):** Requires 3 simultaneous signals to spin. High payout variance.
    *   **Dice Roller:** Fast, low-payout module. Useful for generating frequent "noise" signals to trigger other machines.
    *   **Card Table (Blackjack):** A mini-game played automatically by "Dealer Bot" modules.

*   **New Mechanics:**
    *   **House Edge:** A dynamic difficulty meter that rises as you win too much, reducing global luck.
    *   **Bribes:** Spend Gold to lower the House Edge temporarily.

## Phase 3: The Power Update (Resource Depth)
**Goal:** Replace the flat "1 Energy per Wheel" system with a dynamic Power Grid.

*   **Redesign: Energy -> Power Grid**
    *   Modules now consume **Power (Watts)** constantly, not just when connected.
    *   If Power drops below consumption, modules shut down or run slowly.

*   **New Modules (Generators):**
    *   **Solar Panel:** Generates low power for free.
    *   **Steam Engine:** Burns "Coal" (bought with Gold) to generate medium power.
    *   **Overclocker:** Consumes massive power to boost a target module's speed by 200%.
    *   **Battery:** Stores excess power for bursts (needed for the Slot Machine).

## Phase 4: The Prestige Update (Metagame)
**Goal:** Make resetting (Prestige) a strategic choice with permanent progression.

*   **New System: Artifacts**
    *   Permanent items found rarely or bought with Prestige Points.
    *   *Examples:* "Loaded Dice" (7s are 5% more likely), "Golden Wire" (Signals generate 1 Gold per pixel traveled).

*   **New System: Challenges**
    *   Start a new run with restrictions (e.g., "No Main Roulette", "Only Logic Gates").
    *   Reward: Unlocks unique Artifacts or Skins.

*   **Ascension:**
    *   A second layer of prestige that resets Artifacts but unlocks "Cheats" or "Dev Mode" features in a legitimate way.

## Phase 5: Visual & UI Overhaul
*   **Blueprint Mode:** A flat 2D view for easier wiring of complex logic grids.
*   **Statistics Screen:** Graphs showing Income/s, Signal Density, and Luck distribution.
*   **Themes:** Unlockable skins (Neon, Steampunk, Wood) that change the look of all modules.
